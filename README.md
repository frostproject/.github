# ❄️ Frost Project Software

**Established in December 2024**, Frost Project is a collaborative initiative focused on building open-source software that empowers creativity, freedom, and connection. Our mission is to support a **free and open internet** while pushing the boundaries of **independent game development** and **networking tools**.

We believe in transparency, community-driven innovation, and giving developers around the world the tools they need to express themselves—without gatekeeping or corporate restrictions. From real-time multiplayer systems to creative sandbox game frameworks, everything we build is open for contribution, remixing, and learning.
